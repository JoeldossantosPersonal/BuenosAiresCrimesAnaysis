# BuenosAiresCrimesAnaysis

This GitHub repository hosts a data analysis project that focuses on crimes that occurred in Buenos Aires in the year 2016-2021. The project involves data cleaning, querying using SQL, and visualization using Tableau. Our goal is to provide insights into crime trends, patterns, and hotspots in Buenos Aires, which can be valuable for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the general public.

Data Sources:

We have used publicly available crime data sources provided by Kaggle.com. These data sources data regarding crimes committed in the City of Buenos Aires from 2016 up to 2021, including dates, category of crime, subcategory, latitude, and longitude among others. Also, the dataset contains data regarding the police stations in the City of Buenos Aires, specifying name, address, latitude, and longitude among others.

Data Cleaning: 

Before conducting any analysis, we performed data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2019. We utilized SQL for querying and extracting meaningful insights from the cleaned dataset. SQL queries were crafted to retrieve specific information about the types of crimes, their distribution across neighborhoods, time trends, and more. You can find the SQL queries in the 'SQLqueries' directory within this repository.

Tableau Visualizations: 

The results of our data analysis are visualized using Tableau, providing an interactive and intuitive way to explore the data. We have created various Tableau dashboards and visualizations, including maps, charts, and graphs, to help users understand crime patterns in Buenos Aires.
